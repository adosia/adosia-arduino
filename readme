 About:
 
 This library has three main functions.
    
    create_ed25519_keyfile();
    load_ed25519_keyfile();
    sign_ed25519_tx(String tx);
    
 create_ed25519_keyfile() :: This function checks if a ed25519 key file exists on the device if not it creates one.
 
 load_ed25519_keyfile() :: This function opens the ed25519 file if it exists and returns the psk.
 
 sign_ed25519_tx(String tx) :: This function uses the `load_ed25519_keyfile()` function to load the ed25519 key file and uses the psk to sign the pay load and verifys the signed payload.
